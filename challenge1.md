# Improved add invoice flow for oncharging management
- Interface for adding a new invoice to the spreadsheet/table/database/storage/...
    - create a new object with following properties
        - date
        - sender
        - recipient
        - ordered by brokkr?
- Sort into invoices
    - for start just use an array?
    - sorting revisited light
- recalculate values for current month
    - go through array and check date
    - if date is current month (can specified manually for the start)
    - store the values in an object
- print values for current month
    - print object
